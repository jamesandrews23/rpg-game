Instructios for setting up intellij with github

If you don't already have github installed go to https://git-scm.com/download/win this will start the download for windows

Once you have github installed go to file > settings > github then set the host to github.com
set the Auth Type to Token then create a token, this will fill in the token section.

Click on Git then for Path to Git executable navigate to the git.exe should be located in the bin
of where you installed git. Mine installed here C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe.

At this point you should be able to click on the VCS select checkout from version control
select github then just put in the repository address and that's it.

If you have a local web server set up already you can go to file > settings > build, execute, deployment > deployment
then click the + to add a new module select the local or mounted folder then just add your root folder and your changes
will be added and you can open them up in a web browser.

You can make commits just like we do at work.
